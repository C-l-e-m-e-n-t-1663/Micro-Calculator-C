# Micro-Calculator-C
Here is a micro-calculatrice which I did in a C lesson, but nothing special.

# Use it

1. git clone https://github.com/SendaxSyst/Micro-Calculator-C-EN
2. cd Micro-Calculator-C-EN
3. gcc microcalculatorv1.c -o MicroCalculator (But also, you can make your settings, no problem.)
